A few notable things to point out:

                <li>Judging and Volunteer assignments will be distributed in the coming weeks. </li>
                <li>NEW THIS YEAR- Each performance site will have a reserved seat for a photographer/videographer in the front row of the audience seating. Each team may choose to use this seat to ensure that photos and/or videos are captured for the team. </li>
