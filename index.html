      <p id="mission">
        Our mission is to provide the premiere creative problem solving program for students in Minnesota. 
        Odyssey of the Mind is a non-profit, international creative problem-solving program for students 
        from kindergarten through college. The philosophy behind the Odyssey of the Mind program is that 
        creativity can be learned. In developing their solutions independently, students learn lifelong 
        skills such as teamwork, project management and divergent thinking. Students learn to examine 
        problems and identify the real challenge without limiting the possible solutions and their potential 
        success. In Odyssey of the Mind, there are no wrong answers!
