    There are four steps to joining Odyssey of the Mind and entering a team in the state tournament:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Membership Purchase</b>
        <p>Memberships must be purchased from Odyssey of the Mind International prior to registering teams for a tournament. This gives schools and community groups access to the long term problems. Following purchase, an email confirmation will provide a user name and password for online access to the problems followed by a membership packet that will arrive in the mail. The Program Guide is always available on the bottom of the home page of the National Odyssey of the Mind website.</p>
        <p>A single school, homeschool or community group membership purchase allows one team per problem per division to enter the state tournament. In addition, multiple primary (non-competitive) teams may participate under one membership. This means you only need one membership and can enter multiple teams in our tournament. For example, a K-6 school may enter 5 teams in division I (one in each long-term problem), 5 teams in division II PLUS bring unlimited number of primary (non-competitive) teams. That is 10 competitive teams in the long- term problems and as many primary teams as you want with one single membership!</p>
        <p>Additional memberships must be purchased to enter more than one team in the same problem and division. </p>
        <p>Each membership costs $290, but you will receive discounts if you purchase more than one membership. For each membership purchased, you get five competitive long-term problems, one primary problem, one copy of the Program Guide, one newsletter subscription, and more!</p>

          <b>Team Registration - Register online by February 15th to receive a discounted state tournament fee.</b>
          <p>Register teams for the state tournament at the <a href="http://www.odysseyofthemind.com/members/default.php">Odyssey of the Mind Members Area</a>. The membership number and the membership's zip code are needed to log on. After you have logged into the Members Area, click on the link, "Team Registration", to sign up your team. Required information to register teams:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>School name, address</li>
            <li>School contact (coordinator) phone and email</li>
            <li>Coach, name, address, phone and email</li>

            <li>The name and grade for each team member</li>
          </ul>

          <p>It is important to have all information when registering. As a convenience, a form in either <a href="./resources/TmRegForm.pdf">pdf</a> or
            <a href="./resources/TmRegForm.doc">Microsoft Word</a> is provided for gathering
            team information prior to registering online. Upon successful registration, a confirmation email with the team login and password will be sent to
            the school contact and coach. Care should be taken to enter accurate email addresses for both. If the school contact is also the coach just enter
            the same email address in each place. After registration, the coach information can be updated and team members added by logging in at the <a

              <b>Volunteer Requirement - Sign up online by February 15</b>

              <p>Minnesota Odyssey of the Mind is run completely by volunteers in both "judge" and "volunteer" positions. Each team is required to provide either one full-day judge or two part-day volunteers to help at the tournament.</p>
                <p>A judge must attend training in the morning and cannot step away to watch a team of interest. Visit the <a href="/judges.html">Volunteers and Judges Page</a> for descriptions of the judging positions.</p>
            
                <p>Part-day volunteers need no prior training, can work partial days, and can take time off to watch a team of interest. Some part-day volunteers will be placed in judging positions, such as timer/announcer, scoring, or spontaneous.
                    
                    <p><b>Either a judge or two volunteers need to be signed up by February 15.</b></p>

                    <p>For more information on the volunteers and judges, please view our <a href="./judges.html">Volunteers and Judges Page</a>.
